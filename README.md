# forageable

first push, changing code from python to c++, for learning purposes.

forageable is a project that identifies variables of various forageable objects, and their environmental features,
and illuminates the location on a map based on each day of the season.

The main environmental variables are:

location
elevation
aspect slope of the coordinate
time of season
streetway
rivers

this was originally an art installation to educate people on what part of the mountain, and elevation they should
go on a given day to find morel mushrooms upon selection of 4 latitude and longitude coordinates, and evolved into 
a larger project.

The aspect slope is the angle towards north, east, south, west that the slope of the coodinate is facing. It is basically a representation
of the degrees of a circle in colors (0-360). The elevation has to be factored into the aspect, because mushroom seasons start
from the south facing side, making its way increasing elevation, then throughout the season, the lower elevation of directions start
to be more prolific because the ground is heated up more by where the sun is facing during that specific time in the season.
